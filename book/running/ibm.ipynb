    "Starting from version 5.0, DALES has a grid-conforming Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) implemented. This implementation is a modified version of an older implementation (see [Tomas, 2016](https://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:5d93a697-be49-4f63-b871-b763bc327139)). This section explains the IBM implementation, how to prepare a run with immersed boundaries, and how to start it.   "

    "## General description of the IBM\n",
    "The Immersed Boundary Method implemented in DALES is _grid conforming_, meaning that a computational grid cell is either completely set as _free fluid_ or _solid object_. This effectively changes complex shapes (e.g., inclined roofs) to a cubical representation, which may be innaccurate when the resolution is much coarser than the size of such shapes. The benefit is however its ease of implementation, incl. control over the fluxes and velocity values. Boundaries between fluid and solid always coincide with a cubic face at which the corresponding velocity component is set to zero, thereby ensuring no advection over such boundaries occurs. Momentum and scalar values adjacent to solid cells are corrected by locally adapting the tendencies in two steps:\n",
    "1. regular contributions to the diffusive flux over faces (as if no solid were present) are substracted;\n",
    "2. new contributions as a result of wall drag or wall flux are calculated and added.\n",
    "\n",
    "No correction for subgrid TKE is applied as diffusive flux contribution over walls is assumed to be negligble (which may require further testing). Tendencies for values inside solids are every substep set to correct for any drift, for example, for temperature ```thlp(i,j,k) = (thlibm - thl0(i,j,k))*rk3coefi```.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><< still add sketch >></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, boundary conditions for solid walls are still limited. They are listed below:\n",
    "* **temperature:** Dirichlet condition (fixed temperature) for or zero heat flux across vertical walls and roofs. These values are set to separate constant values for walls ```thlwall``` and roofs ```thlroof```, allowing some thermal response between fluid and solid.\n",
    "* **moisture:** No flux across walls and roofs.\n",
    "* **scalars:** No flux across walls and roofs."

    "## Preparing the IBM file\n",
    "Due to the grid conformity of the IBM, only obstacle heights are required to use the IBM. That implies overhanging structures are not allowed, meaning no fluid cell can be positioned vertically below a solid cell. Obstacle heights should be supplied as a list of values in a file named ```ibm.inp.<iexpnr>```, preceded by seven header lines (see example below). These values are ordered in a row-major ordering, with the first value corresponding to the top-left corner of the domain ```(xmin,ymax)```, the second value being one position to the right ```(xmin+1*dx,ymax)```, and the last value corresponding to the bottom-right corner ```(xmax,ymin)```. \n",

Building representation in OBJ format can be obtained directly via https://3dbag.nl for the Netherlands **or** be created via the open-source software [City4CFD](https://github.com/tudelft3d/City4CFD). Note that the second option is preferred when there is also topography involved and a high degree of accuracy is required. Further, the example assumes that the coordinates are specified in the Dutch RD coordinate system (_Rijksdriehoeksmeting_). Extension to different coordinates is trivial as long as an orthogonal coordinate system is used. \n",

    "Sometimes OBJ files are not readily available and creating them yourself with City4CFD is not feasible. Luckily, many authorities nowadays have made accurate LiDAR scans (point clouds) publicly available. For example, tiled LiDAR scans for the Netherlands (AHN) can accessed via [GeoTiles](https://geotiles.citg.tudelft.nl/) and tiled scans for France can be accessed via [IGN France](https://geoservices.ign.fr/lidarhd). Such LiDAR scans can be quickly voxelized for use with our IBM. Further, most LiDAR return points have a classification, which makes it possible to separate buildings from ground points. The table below shows the typical classification used by the Dutch AHN scans (which may vary among different institutes). \n",

    "| `26`     | reserved for ASPRS definition| \n",
    "\n",
    "The example below shows the basics of processing such LiDAR scans. Note that the size of the domain is inferred from the dimensions of the LiDAR tile (assumed to be in meters). If you want only part of the domain, you will have to subsample ```data_les``` yourself. Likewise, if you want to simulate a larger region, you have to merge LiDAR tiles yourself. \n",
