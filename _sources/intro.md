# DALES documentation

Welcome to the documentation of the Dutch Atmospheric Large-Eddy Simulation (in short: DALES)!

```{note}
This documentation is a work-in-progress and for a future release of DALES.
```

The aim of this manual is to provide an up-to-date starting point for new users, explaining how to compile, setup and run the Dutch Atmospheric Large-Eddy Simulation. The manual will cover, among other things, general settings, and options (for example, statistics output), and instructions how to make more advanced cases (for example, simulations with tracers). The principles of the DALES model are described in [Heus et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-3-415-2010).

```{note}
This manual is written for the main-branch (v. X.Y) in mind. Other branches may contain new features that are not necessarily described in this manual.
```

At a later stage, this manual may be extended with in-depth information on code structure, variable naming schemes, and implementation details, better enabling people to become _new contributors_ to DALES.
