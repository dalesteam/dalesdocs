    "## Generic compilation\n",
    "The next step after obtaining the code and installing required dependencies, is to build the code. As a starting point, we assume you are still in the main `dales` directory after checking out the main branch via git. It is advised the build the code in a different folder to better maintain overview. We therefore first move one directory up, make a new directory and move into that directory.\n",
    "```{code} shell\n",
    "cd ../\n",
    "mkdir build\n",
    "cd build\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We then invoke `cmake` on the directory where the code is placed. This will configure the build of the code.\n",
    "```{code} shell\n",
    "cmake ../dales \n",
    "```\n",
    "Finally, the code can be build with the following command:\n",
    "```{code} shell\n",
    "make \n",
    "```\n",
    "After successfull compilation, the executable `dales4.4` (@team: number to change) is located in the subdirectory `src/`. Compilation of the code may be sped up using the `-j <nprocs>` specifier, with `nprocs` being the amount of parallel processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Compilation options\n",
    "It is possible to specify optional features at the compilation stage of the model. These optional features can be activated by adding them as specifyers to the cmake command, for example, \n",
    "```{code} shell\n",
    "cmake ../dales -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug\n",
    "```\n",
    "will produce a debug build. The debug build is much slower than the release build but contains more error checks. A list of other compilation options is shown below\n",

    "`-DPOIS_PRECISION=32` and `-DUSE_HYPRE=True` can be used together, but HYPRE is 64-bit only, so only use this, if it is really what you want.\n",
